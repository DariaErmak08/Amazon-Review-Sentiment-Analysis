# 📝 Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes customer reviews from Amazon to uncover insights into product perception through sentiment classification and rating comparison. Using text preprocessing and visualizations such as word clouds and boxplots, we explore the relationships between user sentiment, rating behavior, and product recommendation.

## ✅ Key Highlights

- **Positive reviews dominate** the dataset (~89%), indicating overall product satisfaction.
- **Sentiment and rating don't always align**: Some negative reviews have high ratings and vice versa.
- **Word clouds** show common themes, but deeper NLP may improve emotional nuance detection.
- **Boxplots** reveal most negative reviews still rate 3+ stars, while recommended products cluster around 4–5 stars.
- **Around 25% of users gave high ratings but didn’t recommend** the product — these need deeper investigation.
